BINARY SEARCH (Important in respect to interview)  : This is applied when we have sorted arrays or there is contiguous selection of elements 
```
1. When two sorted array :

BINARY SEARCH TREE
There are very limited BST problems which are asked in interview. Patterns are similar in every problem.

1. Construct BST from preorder traversal
